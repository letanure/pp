# Project Name: pp

## Overview

This project is a basic setup using Vite for development and build processes,
along with TypeScript for type checking and Biome for linting and formatting.

## Scripts

- **dev**: Starts the development server using Vite.
- **build**: Compiles TypeScript and builds the project using Vite.
- **preview**: Previews the built project using Vite.
- **lint**: Lints the project using Biome.
- **lint:md**: Lints and fixes markdown files using markdownlint.
- **format**: Formats the code using Biome.
- **release:local**: Updates version and publishes changes locally using Changesets.
- **prepublishOnly**: Runs the CI script before publishing.
- **test**: Runs tests using Vitest.
- **ci**: Runs linting, markdown linting, export linting, builds the project, and runs tests.

## Development Dependencies

- **@biomejs/biome**: A tool for linting and formatting.
- **typescript**: A language for application-scale JavaScript.
- **vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **lefthook**: A tool for managing Git hooks.
- **@commitlint/cli**: A tool for linting commit messages.
- **@commitlint/config-conventional**: A shareable commitlint configuration for conventional commits.
- **cspell**: A spell checker for code.
- **markdownlint-cli**: A command-line interface for linting markdown files.
- **@changesets/cli**: A tool for managing versioning and publishing.
- **vitest**: A test runner for Vite projects.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install Lefthook**:

   ```sh
   npx lefthook install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build the project**:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Preview the built project**:

   ```sh
   npm run preview
   ```

6. **Lint the project**:

   ```sh
   npm run lint
   ```

7. **Lint and fix markdown files**:

   ```sh
   npm run lint:md
   ```

8. **Format the code**:

   ```sh
   npm run format
   ```

9. **Check spelling**:

   ```sh
   npm run cspell
   ```

10. **Release locally**:

    ```sh
    npm run release:local
    ```

11. **Run tests**:

    ```sh
    npm run test
    ```

12. **Run CI script**:

    ```sh
    npm run ci
    ```

## Git Hooks

This project uses Lefthook to manage Git hooks.

### Pre-commit Hook

Runs Biome to check and fix issues in staged files before committing.

### Commit Message Hook

Uses Commitlint to ensure commit messages follow the conventional commit format.

### Pre-push Hook

Runs CSpell to check for spelling errors in the code before pushing.

Runs markdownlint to check and fix issues in markdown files before pushing.

## Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### CI Workflow

The CI workflow runs on every push to the `main` branch and on pull requests. It performs the following steps:

1. **Checkout code**: Uses `actions/checkout@v4` to checkout the repository.
2. **Setup Node.js**: Uses `actions/setup-node@v4` to set up Node.js version 20.
3. **Install dependencies**: Runs `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. **Run CI script**: Runs `npm run ci` to lint, build, and test the project.
